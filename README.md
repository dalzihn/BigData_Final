# Group 09, Exploring Apache Spark's performance and its application in mining research topics on COVID-19

This repo represents the final project of group 09 for the course *Big Data and Applications*. In this project, we provide an in-depth analysis of Spark's performance based on time and throughput in comparison with NTLK and Scikit-learn. Additionally, we will also train and apply LDA model to discover latent topics related to COVID-19 using [CORD-19](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge) on Kaggle.
