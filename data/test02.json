Methods: The CPVT involves placement of a vibrating cellphone on the center of the forehead to determine which ear perceives the sound louder. 40 consecutive adult patients with an audiogram within 6 months and no report of recent hearing changes were recruited. Group 1 consisted of 20 patients who were examined by the provider with the CPVT and WTFT using various tuning forks (256, 512, and 1024 Hz). Group 2 consisted of an additional 20 patients who received instructions on selfadministering the CPVT. Kappa statistics were calculated to assess the strength of concordance between the CPVT, WTFT, and audiometric findings for group 1 and between patient self-administered and provider administered CPVT and WTFT for group 2. Results: Concordance between CPVT and WTFT in the entire cohort was substantial (Kappa coefficient: 0.81 for 256 Hz, 0.73 for 512 Hz, and 0.62 for 1024 Hz) with similar concordances between actual and expected results based on audiogram (Kappa coefficient: 0.52 for CPVT and 0.52 for WTFT). Concordance between patient-administered and provider-administered CPVT showed almost perfect agreement (Kappa coefficient: 0.92). Conclusions: The CPVT provides consistent results when compared to a formal WTFT and can be reliably self-administered by patients with appropriate instructions.

Concurrent improvements in video conferencing technology and the convenience afforded by telemedicine have allowed virtual health practices to persist even after many clinics have begun returning to in-person practice. Nevertheless, a primary disadvantage of telemedicine remains its relative inability to perform a complete physical examination, at least not in the same manner one would in clinic.

            "text": "The ability to rapidly and effectively identify sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is essential. SSNHL-with an incidence in the United States of 5 to 27 per 100 000 people 1 -is one of the few true otologic emergencies requiring expedited evaluation. Current guidelines recommend the initiation of oral or intratympanic steroids within 14 days of symptom onset. 2, 3 Although 32% to 65% of SSNHL cases recover spontaneously, 4 delay in management may lead to residual tinnitus, vertigo, and permanent hearing loss as well as significant negative impacts on quality of life. 2, 5, 6 Audiometry is the gold standard for diagnosing SSNHL; however, this requires appropriately trained staff and equipment which may not be readily available. Thus, the first step in evaluating a patient with suspected SSNHL begins with a history and physical examination to exclude conductive hearing loss (CHL). 2, 3 Tuning fork tests remain a fundamental part of the otologic examination. Lateralization of the Weber turning fork test (WTFT) to the affected ear has historically differentiated CHL from SNHL. 7 Alternatives to the WTFT such as the hum test and the bandage scratch test have been proposed, but neither of these methods have been appropriately validated for general otology patients. The overall clinical data base studying these alternative tests is thin and external validity was limited as they were performed on patients with normal hearing with simulated CHL or solely on postoperative patients. 8, 9 Given the ubiquity of cellphones, utilization of the native vibration function of a mobile phone as a surrogate for a tuning fork is a newer proposed alternative. One study demonstrated the use of smartphone vibration as a replacement to the WTFT on an inpatient ward, but the external validity of this study was limited as it was performed only on patients with a simulated CHL. 10 Another study performed on 60 consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department with unilateral sudden hearing loss found smartphone vibration as an adequate substitute when a provider may not have access to a tuning fork. 11 Further demonstrating the cell phone vibration test's (CPVT) utility for effective and accurate patient self-administration at home would dramatically enhance the telemedicine encounter for patients with SSNHL. Not only would it reduce COVID-19 exposure risk, but it may also assist clinicians in resource scarce settings triage which patients will need expedited, in-person care.",

After informed consent was given prior to participation, 40 consecutive adult patients presenting to a tertiary care otology practice were assessed. Inclusion criteria required that patients had a pre-existing comprehensive pure-tone audiogram performed within the past 6 months and no reported subjective changes in hearing. Patient demographics and ICD-10 coded diagnosis were recorded. Patients who were under the age of 18, had pre-existing implant devices, or had a recent subjective change in hearing of either ear within the past 6 months were excluded. The CPVT consists of using a standard smart phone without a phone case and placing it on a continuous vibration setting. A corner of the vibrating smartphone is placed firmly on the anterior midline forehead (Figure 1A). The patient is then asked in which ear the vibration is heard loudest (or if it is equal on both sides), and the vibration is continuously replayed until the patient feels confident in their F I G U R E 1 (A) Cell phone vibration test and (B) traditional Weber tuning fork testtuning forks. The results of the CPVT were compared to the formal WTFT. Group 2 consisted of the subsequent 20 patients. These individuals were provided verbal instructions and a visual handout on how to self-administer the CPVT (Figure 2).

The ability to properly follow directions is especially important in patients with hearing loss who have previously been demonstrated to have decreased health literacy relative to typical hearing individuals.23 Having a validated virtual exam maneuver for the differentiation of CHL and SNHL has significant diagnostic utility in the telemedicine management of SSNHL. Even in normal in-person clinical settings, there is a considerable amount of variability and delay in workup. A Department of Defense study on SSNHL found that 75% of patients presented to their primary care manager (PCM) or the emergency department (ED) within 5 days of symptom onset, yet they were not seen by an otolaryngologist until an average of 15 days post-onset.",

Because some of the cohort were follow up patients, some individuals likely were aware of their diagnosis, a fact that may have biased their interpretation of the CPVT and WTFT. Additionally, the CPVT seemed to share the highest overall agreement with the 256 Hz tuning fork rather than the more commonly used 512 Hz tuning fork in the present study. This may be a logical finding given the cell phone's fundamental frequency to be measured at 148.9 Hz using Praat Software (version 6.1.42), a free computer program that analyzes phonetics, but results could vary with utilization of different cell phone types as the fundamental frequency of various vibrations were not assessed. Other studies, however, have measured a similar frequency in different makes and models of cell phones, indicating that the frequency of vibration is relatively consistent across samples.11,27 Future directions of our work include blinding provider and subject to the audiogram or audiometric diagnosis, inclusion of more patients with SNHL, and studying the CPVT in a true telemedicine environment.",

Again, the CPVT is not meant to replace the audiogram, but rather serve to expedite care in the telemedicine setting where tuning forks are often unavailable. Patients for whom SSNHL is suspected using the CPVT should undergo formal comprehensive audiometry and, if confirmed, appropriate imaging to rule out retrocochlear lesions.",
